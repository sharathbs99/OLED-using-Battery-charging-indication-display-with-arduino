# OLED-using-Battery-charging-indication-display-with-arduino
Using the I2C interface reduces the wiring of this OLED screen very strongly, 128 x 32 pixels. The screen is powered by 3.3V, it uses the same microcontroller SSD1306.If you have an Arduino Uno, connect the A4 Pin to the SDA Pin (Serial data) of the screen and port A5 to the SCL Pin (Serial CLock). Some cards have dedicated SDA / SCL pins. Otherwise, here is a small table that summarizes the SDA and SCL connectors for various current Arduino boards. this project for charging battery indication on OLED display using Arduino uno
